## About the dataset

In the file *tidy_data_set.txt* refers to an experiment in which 30 volunteers wore a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone at their waist and performed randomly defined activities. The smartphone generated data through its internal sensors, accelerometer and gyroscope, in addition to the time variable. The original experiment generated 561 resource vectors that span time and frequency, plus some estimates.

For this project I am interested only in measurements covering averages and standard deviation.

In the Data Set Structure topic, I'll talk about what each column in the dataset means, and I'll also indicate some counts about the data. In "Measured Variables" there will be the composition of the name of the variable, which indicates descriptively which sensor used, what it measured, in which domain and axis.
In References I indicate the experiment that generated the original data set and some sources that aided the sequence of this script.
